- **Timing Mechanism**: Starts a timer for one minute during which the user types the paragraph.
- **Performance Metrics**: After typing, it displays metrics including:
  - Characters per minute (CPM)
  - Words per minute (WPM)
  - Number of incorrect characters
  - Accuracy percentage
- **User-friendly Interface**: Intuitive GUI for easy interaction.

## Technologies
- Python
- Tkinter (for GUI)

## Usage
1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. Click the "Start" button to begin the typing test.
3. Type the displayed paragraph within the time limit.
4. Results will be displayed after the timer stops.

## Notes
This project showcases the use of GUI programming in Python, timer functions, and text processing for evaluating typing performance.
